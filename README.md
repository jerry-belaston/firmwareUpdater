## üí° Overview

Firmware Updater is a C++ Qt application simulating firmware update process of mock devices (xml files) based on JSON information coming from a mock server. 

This application has been implemented following [MVPMV architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2011/december/mvpvm-design-pattern-the-model-view-presenter-viewmodel-design-pattern-for-wpf) approach. It demonstrates by the way the responsiveness of the Qt GUI regarding thread notifications.

This application offers two modes:
- Single: one device at a time can be updated.
- Multi: several devices can be simultaneously updated.

Note that default JSON templates and XML devices files are located close to the application executable (into into firmwareUpdater.app/Contents/MacOS on MacOS)

Let you discover! Have fun :wink:
